New Line

and another addition
Extra

We are learning git!

Changing

Add

git show (commit history checksum)

git log -p (Shows the log history with changes done for each push)

git log --graph (Shows a visualization of the branches)

git log -grep='Give the name or word in the commit phrase' (Used to find the commit with the word)

git mv example.txt example2.txt (Used to chnage file name)

Git doesn't keep track of empty folder

.gitkeep file is added to the empty folder so git keeps track of the folder

Learning undo chnages

git restore --staged . (Removes files from staging area)

git restore file name (Removes changes from working directory)
