and another addition
Extra

We are learning git!

Changing

Add

git show (commit history checksum)

git log -p (Shows the log history with changes done for each push)

git log --graph (Shows a visualization of the branches)

git log -grep='Give the name or word in the commit phrase' (Used to find the commit with the word)

git mv example.txt example2.txt (Used to chnage file name)

Git doesn't keep track of empty folder

.gitkeep file is added to the empty folder so git keeps track of the folder

Learning undo chnages

git restore --staged . (Removes files from staging area)

git restore file name (Removes changes from working directory)

git checkout commit history checksum (This will help in viewing the changes done in the past commit)
git checkout main (This comes back to the main head after viewing the change done in a previous commit)

git revert commit checksum (Reverts the commit done there)

git commit must be present tense
describes what change has been done
max of 50 characters
